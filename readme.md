# Tech test for HolidayExtras
This is the front end portion of the tech test for HolidayExtras

# Getting Started
## Installing
- `npm install` should do all the heavy lifting.
- `npm run build` bundles the code to `./bundle.js`.
- `npm run css` turns the sass in `style.scss` into usable css in `style.css`

## Running
- Run a local server over `http` using something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and visit your local url.

## TODO
- Add more rigorous mistake/error checking in functions
- Add sorting
- Add proper unit testing unit suite
- Add searching by username

## Built With
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/)
- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
